# Inventory application prototype v1.0

You have been tasked to create a prototype for an inventory application. 
The application will be used to track the inventory of a store. The application will have the following features:

* Add a new item to the inventory
* Print the inventory
* Search for an item in the inventory

The item will have the following properties:

* Item Id
* Item Name
* Item Description
* Item Price
* Item Quantity

The application will be a command line application. 
The application will have a menu that will allow the user to select the feature they want to use. 
The application will have a loop that will continue to display the menu until the user selects the exit option.

Since this is a prototype, you will not be required to store the data in a database.
You will be required to store the information of 10 items 
in the inventory.

You will have to:

* Identify the domain objects that will be used in the application
* Identify the helper classess that will be used in the application

Fork this repository first and then clone it to your local machine.

This will not be a hobbes enabled assignment.
