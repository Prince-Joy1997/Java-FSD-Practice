Book reading is a great habit that we cultivate to enhance our vocabulary skills. In today's online world reading has taken a back seat.

The Just Reading Library is a new venture that has come up with a unique methodology to service its members, and acquire new members on the go. The Just Reading Library is a mobile library that has a member base in tier 2 towns, in order to encourage reading. 

The mobile van with books travels across the town,and those who want to become a member can do so by registering with Just Reading Library, by providing their basic information like name, address etc, and a unique membership code is generated for each of them. An executive enters the data provided by the member into an in house application so that a membership account is created for each member to keep track of the the personal information, address, books borrowed etc.

>Task 1:

- Identify the attributes to onboard a member into the library. 
- Design the classes, their attributes and behaviour.

Note : generate a unique Id for each member.

>Task 2:

 - A member must be able to borrow books from the library
 - A member must be able to return the books borrowed.
 
 Capture only the above two features in your program.
