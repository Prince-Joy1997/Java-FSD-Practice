## Problem Statement: Understanding Custom exception handling ##

**This exercise should be completed using Test Driven Development Technique**

- Test classes provided in this exercise will show compilation errors, when the exercise is cloned locally
- Classes and methods should be created by analysing the test code, so that there are no compilation errors
- Functionality of methods should be completed, such that all the test cases pass
- Some of the requirements/hints are mentioned below

- In this problem, while withdrawing money from account, custom exceptions should be used for below scenarios
            
            Withdrawing amount from the given bank account less than zero should throw NegativeIntegerException
            Withdrawing amount from the given bank account greater than the balance should throw InsufficientFundException
            
       
## Instructions
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected output as given in sample
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Do not change the provided class/method names unless instructed
- Follow best practices while coding
